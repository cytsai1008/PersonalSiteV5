# Project Overview

This project is a personal website that showcases two different aspects of the owner's life: "Real Life" and "Furry Life". It's a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is responsive, with a different layout for desktop and mobile devices.

## Main Technologies

*   **HTML:** The structure and content of the website are defined in `index.html`.
*   **CSS:** The website is styled with CSS, located in `style.css`. It uses modern CSS features like flexbox and has a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **JavaScript:** The file `script.js` adds interactivity to the website, including hover effects and click animations.
*   **Linting:** The project uses `eslint`, `htmlhint`, and `stylelint` to enforce code quality and consistency.

## Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Linting

To run the linters, you can use the following commands:

*   `npx eslint .`
*   `npx htmlhint index.html`
*   `npx stylelint style.css`

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The project uses `eslint`, `htmlhint`, and `stylelint` to enforce a consistent code style. The specific rules are defined in the `.eslintrc.json`, and `.stylelintrc.json` files.
*   **Testing:** There are no automated tests for this project.
*   **Branching:** The project is hosted on GitHub, but there are no specific branching conventions mentioned.
